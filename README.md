Haskell Stack and Dependency Warmup
===================================

This produces a builder image that includes Stack
from FP Complete and some installed dependencies.

The purpose of this is to have a baseline for creating
docker-based Haskell code builders.

Future direction for this project includes creating a
builder image suitable for CI/CD.
